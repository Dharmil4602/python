# print('Hello')
# x = 2
# y = float(x)
# print(type(y))
# print(dir("strings"))
# print(" ")
# print(dir("int"))
# print(" ")
# print(dir("float"))


## String Formatter
## First String Formating Method.
# x = "Hello..!!"
# y = "My Name Is"
# z = "Alex And My Age Is:"
# a = 20

# e = x + " " + y + " " + z
# e = "My Name Is {} {}".format(z,a) ## We have used format method because considering that users name is not provided and is being entered dynamically. Here {} are used to represent the value of z. There can be more than one {}.

# print(e)

## Second String Formatting Method.

# e = f"My name is {z} {a}" ## Here we have used f in the starting which is used for formatting the string according to our need.
# print(e)

## String Formatting Using List

# hey = ["Dev", "Sports", "20"]
# e = f"My name is {hey[0]}, my hobby is {hey[1]} and my age is {hey[2]}"
# print(e)

## String Formatting Ended

## List Data Type Starts

## --> List is simply defined as the array of strings, numbers, etc.

# print(dir(list)) ## This will shows how many methods we can use with list

x = ["Hello", "There", "How", "Are", "You", 8, 10.6]
# print("Length Of List x is: ", len(x)) ## Prints the length of the list

# x.pop() ## Here last element if removed
# x.append(11) ## Here element is added at last position
# x.remove("There") ## Here selected element is removed from the list
# del x ## Deletes the list
print(x)

## Likewise there are other methods in list

## List Data Type Ended
